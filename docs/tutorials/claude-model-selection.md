> **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate
> **Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of TypeScript, familiarity with API usage
> **Version**: Claude 3 (2024)

## Quick Reference

```typescript
// Initialize with default strategy (Haiku for low/medium, Sonnet for high, Opus for critical)
const taskMaster = new ClaudeTaskMaster({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });

// Create task with complexity
const task = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: 'Your prompt here',
  complexity: 'low', // Options: "low", "medium", "high", "critical"
});

// Override model selection
const task = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: 'Your prompt here',
  complexity: 'low',
  model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229', // Manual override
});
```

## Overview

This tutorial explains how to use our Claude model selection strategy to optimize both cost and performance when working with Anthropic's Claude AI models. The strategy automatically selects the most appropriate model based on task complexity, helping you balance cost efficiency with performance.

## Available Models

Claude offers three main models with different capabilities and cost profiles:

| Model               | Strengths                         | Best For                                | Relative Cost |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Claude 3 Haiku**  | Fast, efficient, cost-effective   | Simple tasks, basic questions           | $ (Lowest)    |
| **Claude 3 Sonnet** | Balanced performance and cost     | Complex analysis, creative tasks        | $$ (Medium)   |
| **Claude 3 Opus**   | Highest capability, most powerful | Critical tasks requiring deep expertise | $$$ (Highest) |

## How Our Strategy Works

Our implementation automatically selects the appropriate Claude model based on task complexity:

1. **Low/Medium Complexity Tasks**: Uses Claude 3 Haiku (most cost-effective)
2. **High Complexity Tasks**: Uses Claude 3 Sonnet (balanced performance/cost)
3. **Critical Tasks**: Uses Claude 3 Opus (highest capability)

This approach optimizes for both cost and performance by using more powerful (and expensive) models only when necessary.

## Using the Model Selection in Your Code

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ClaudeTaskMaster } from '@/lib/claude/taskmaster';

// Initialize the TaskMaster
const taskMaster = new ClaudeTaskMaster({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

// Create a task with complexity information
const task = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms',
  complexity: 'medium', // Will use Claude 3 Haiku by default
});

// Execute the task
const result = await taskMaster.executeTask(task.id);

// Check which model was used
console.log(`Model used: ${result.model}`);
```

### Specifying Task Complexity

When creating a task, specify its complexity to trigger the appropriate model selection:

```typescript
// Low complexity task (will use Haiku)
const simpleTask = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: "What's the capital of France?",
  complexity: 'low',
});

// Medium complexity task (will use Haiku)
const mediumTask = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: 'Summarize this article about climate change',
  complexity: 'medium',
});

// High complexity task (will use Sonnet)
const complexTask = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: 'Analyze the implications of this research paper',
  complexity: 'high',
});

// Critical task (will use Opus)
const criticalTask = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: 'Debug this complex algorithm and suggest optimizations',
  complexity: 'critical',
});
```

### Overriding the Model Selection

You can override the automatic model selection by explicitly specifying a model:

```typescript
// Override to use Opus for a task that would normally use Haiku
const task = await taskMaster.createTask({
  description: "What's the capital of France?",
  complexity: 'low',
  model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229', // Override to use Opus
});
```

## Using the UI Component

The `ClaudeTaskForm` component allows users to:

1. Enter their prompt or question
2. Select the task complexity
3. Optionally override the model selection

```tsx
import { ClaudeTaskForm } from '@/components/ClaudeTaskForm';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Ask Claude</h1>
      <ClaudeTaskForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component automatically displays which model was used and the estimated token usage after receiving a response.

## Customizing the Model Selection Strategy

You can customize the model selection strategy when initializing the `ClaudeTaskMaster`:

```typescript
const taskMaster = new ClaudeTaskMaster({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  defaultModel: 'claude-3-haiku-20240229',
  modelStrategy: {
    // Custom strategy - use Sonnet for medium complexity and above
    low: 'claude-3-haiku-20240229',
    medium: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    high: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    critical: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Low Complexity**: Default to low complexity for most tasks and increase only when needed
2. **Monitor Token Usage**: Keep track of token usage to understand costs
3. **Use Opus Sparingly**: Reserve the most powerful model for truly critical tasks
4. **Test Different Models**: Experiment with different models to find the optimal balance for your specific use cases

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Similar Tasks**: Group similar tasks together to avoid switching models
2. **Pre-process Inputs**: Simplify and focus inputs to reduce token usage
3. **Use System Prompts**: Well-crafted system prompts can improve results with less powerful models
4. **Cache Common Responses**: Store responses for frequently asked questions

## Example Use Cases

| Task Type          | Example                                 | Recommended Complexity | Model  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| Simple questions   | "What's the weather today?"             | Low                    | Haiku  |
| Basic summaries    | "Summarize this short article"          | Low                    | Haiku  |
| Explanations       | "Explain how photosynthesis works"      | Medium                 | Haiku  |
| Creative writing   | "Write a short story about space"       | Medium                 | Haiku  |
| Complex analysis   | "Analyze the themes in this poem"       | High                   | Sonnet |
| Technical tasks    | "Debug this code and explain the issue" | High                   | Sonnet |
| Expert knowledge   | "Explain quantum computing principles"  | Critical               | Opus   |
| Critical reasoning | "Evaluate this complex research paper"  | Critical               | Opus   |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                       | Solution                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task fails with no response | Check your API key and network connection                  |
| Model selection not working | Ensure you're specifying a valid complexity level          |
| High token usage            | Try reducing prompt length or using a more specific prompt |
| Unexpected model selection  | Check your modelStrategy configuration                     |

### Debugging Tips

```typescript
// Log the model being used
console.log(`Using model: ${task.model}`);

// Check token usage after execution
console.log(`Tokens used: ${result.tokensUsed}`);

// Inspect the full task configuration
console.log(JSON.stringify(task, null, 2));
```

## Conclusion

The Claude model selection strategy provides an optimal balance between cost and performance by using the most appropriate model for each task based on its complexity. By defaulting to the most cost-effective model (Haiku) and only using more powerful models when necessary, you can achieve significant cost savings while still delivering high-quality results.
