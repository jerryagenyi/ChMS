# Security & Privacy Policy - ChMS

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security measures and data privacy practices implemented in the ChMS application.

## 2. Data Security

- **Data Encryption:**
  - **In Transit:** All communication between the client, application server, and database is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
  - **At Rest:** Sensitive data stored in the PostgreSQL database should be encrypted where appropriate (e.g., using database-level encryption features or application-level encryption for specific fields).
- **Data Minimization:** We only collect and store data essential for the application's functionality.
- **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to ensure users can only access data relevant to their permissions.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication:** Handled by NextAuth.js, supporting secure credential login and potentially other providers (e.g., Google, if configured).
- **Session Management:** Secure session tokens managed by NextAuth.js with appropriate expiration and security flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- **Password Security:** Passwords are never stored in plaintext. Hashed using a strong, salted algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) via NextAuth.js adapters or custom logic.
- **Authorization (RBAC):** API routes and server actions validate user roles and permissions before performing operations or returning data.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (e.g., login, password reset) to prevent brute-force attacks.

## 4. Application Security

- **Input Validation:** All user input is validated on the server-side using Zod schemas to prevent invalid data and potential injection attacks.
- **Output Encoding:** Data rendered in the UI is appropriately encoded (React handles much of this automatically) to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** NextAuth.js provides built-in CSRF protection for relevant actions.
- **Security Headers:** Implement standard security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`) via Next.js configuration or middleware.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or GitHub Dependabot.

## 5. Infrastructure Security

- **Hosting Provider:** Rely on the security features provided by the hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS).
- **Database Security:** Secure database access with strong credentials, network restrictions (firewalls), and regular patching.
- **Secret Management:** Environment variables and secrets are managed securely using hosting provider features or dedicated secret management tools (not committed to the repository).

## 6. Privacy Policy

_(This section needs to be developed based on legal requirements and specific data handling practices)_

- **Data Collection:** Clearly state what personal data is collected and why.
- **Data Usage:** Explain how collected data is used.
- **Data Sharing:** Disclose if data is shared with any third parties.
- **User Rights:** Outline user rights regarding their data (access, correction, deletion).
- **Cookies:** Explain the use of cookies and tracking technologies.
- **Contact Information:** Provide contact details for privacy-related inquiries.

## 7. Incident Response

_(Define a basic plan)_

- **Detection:** Monitoring and alerting for security events.
- **Containment:** Steps to isolate affected systems or accounts.
- **Eradication:** Removing the cause of the incident.
- **Recovery:** Restoring systems and data.
- **Post-Mortem:** Analyzing the incident to prevent recurrence.

## 8. Regular Audits

- Perform periodic security audits (manual code review, vulnerability scanning).
- Keep security practices and documentation updated.
