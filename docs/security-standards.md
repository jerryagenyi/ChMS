# Security Standards

## Overview

Security standards specifically tailored for our Church Management System (ChMS), balancing robust security with performance requirements.

## Authentication

### User Authentication Implementation

1. Secure Login

   - Implement password-based authentication with email
   - Use Argon2id for password hashing (balanced security/performance)
   - Rate limit login attempts (max 5 attempts/5 minutes)
   - Implement progressive security measures to maintain performance

2. Session Management

   - Use HttpOnly, Secure cookies for session tokens
   - Implement sliding session expiration (2 hours default)
   - Maintain session registry for concurrent login control
   - Session data caching for performance optimization

3. Multi-Factor Authentication
   - Optional 2FA for administrative roles
   - Support TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
   - Fallback to email-based verification
   - Cache 2FA verification status (5 minutes)

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

1. Church-Specific Roles

   - Super Admin (System level)
   - Church Admin (Organization level)
   - Ministry Leader (Ministry unit level)
   - Staff Member (Limited administrative access)
   - Member (Basic access)

2. Permission Sets

   - Attendance Management
     - View attendance records
     - Record attendance
     - Generate reports
   - Member Management
     - View member profiles
     - Edit member details
     - Manage family units
   - Ministry Management
     - Create/edit ministry units
     - Assign leaders/members
     - Manage ministry events

3. Access Control Implementation
   - Use middleware for route protection
   - Implement view-level permission checks
   - Cache permission checks (1 minute TTL)
   - Audit all permission changes

## Data Security

### Personal Information Protection

1. Member Data Encryption

   - Encrypt sensitive fields (contact details, family information)
   - Use AES-256-GCM for field-level encryption
   - Implement key rotation policy
   - Cache decrypted data briefly (30 seconds)

2. Data Access Controls
   - Implement data access logging
   - Restrict PII access by role
   - Enforce data retention policies
   - Monitor unusual access patterns

### Security-Performance Balance

1. Caching Strategy

   - Cache permission checks
   - Cache non-sensitive user data
   - Use Redis for session storage
   - Implement cache invalidation

2. Performance Optimization
   - Batch database operations
   - Optimize encryption operations
   - Minimize authentication overhead
   - Use connection pooling

## Integration with Development Standards

### Secure Coding Practices

1. Input Validation

   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data for XSS prevention
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement request size limits

2. Output Encoding
   - Encode all dynamic content
   - Use Content Security Policy
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Set security headers

### Security Testing Requirements

1. Automated Security Tests

   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
   - Dependency scanning
   - Regular penetration testing

2. Performance Impact Testing
   - Measure authentication overhead
   - Monitor encryption performance
   - Test security feature impact
   - Benchmark security middleware

## Compliance

### Data Protection

1. GDPR Compliance

   - Implement data export
   - Support data deletion
   - Track consent
   - Document processing activities

2. Church-Specific Requirements
   - Protect attendance records
   - Secure donation data
   - Manage ministry assignments
   - Control access to pastoral notes

## Security Monitoring

1. Real-time Monitoring

   - Log security events
   - Monitor authentication attempts
   - Track permission changes
   - Alert on suspicious activity

2. Performance Monitoring
   - Track security overhead
   - Monitor response times
   - Measure encryption impact
   - Log security cache hits/misses
