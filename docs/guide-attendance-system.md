# Attendance Management System Guide

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This guide will help you understand how our attendance system works in a simple way.

## 1. Overview

Think of our attendance system like a digital register that helps track who's present at church services, classes and events. It's like taking attendance in school, but way cooler with QR codes! ðŸ˜Ž

## 2. Main Features

### 2.1 Check-in System

- **QR Code Check-in**: Like scanning a ticket at the cinema
- **Manual Check-in**: For when QR scanning isn't possible (like when someone forgets their code)
- **Family Check-in**: Makes it easy to check in multiple family members at once

### 2.2 Attendance Tracking

- **Service Attendance**: Track who comes to church services
- **Class Attendance**: Keep record of who attends different classes
- **Event Attendance**: Keep record of who came for our events
- **Reports**: See attendance patterns and statistics

## 5. Database Tables Used

Our system uses these main tables (think of them as Excel sheets):

1. **Attendance**:

   ```prisma
   model Attendance {
     id        String   @id @default(cuid())
     memberId  String
     serviceId String
     timestamp DateTime @default(now())
     type      String   // INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY
     // ... other fields
   }
   ```

2. **Member**:

   ```prisma
   model Member {
     id        String   @id @default(cuid())
     name      String
     qrCode    String   @unique
     // ... other fields
   }
   ```

3. **Service**:
   ```prisma
   model Service {
     id        String   @id @default(cuid())
     name      String
     date      DateTime
     // ... other fields
   }
   ```

## 6. Testing Tips

When testing the system, try these scenarios:

1. **QR Code Flow**:

   - Test QR code generation
   - Test QR code scanning
   - Test error handling
   - Test offline scenarios

2. **Manual Check-in Flow**:

   - Test form validation
   - Test data submission
   - Test error states
   - Test success feedback

3. **Reports Testing**:
   - Test data aggregation
   - Test date filtering
   - Test export functionality
   - Test performance with large datasets

## 7. Common Issues and Solutions

1. **QR Code Won't Scan?**

   - Check camera permissions
   - Verify QR code format
   - Test with different lighting conditions
   - Implement fallback options

2. **Can't Find a Member?**

   - Check search functionality
   - Verify database queries
   - Test with different search criteria
   - Implement fuzzy search

3. **Reports Not Showing?**
   - Check data fetching
   - Verify date ranges
   - Test with different data sets
   - Implement error boundaries

Remember: The system is designed to be flexible - if one method doesn't work, there's always a backup way! ðŸ˜Š

## 8. Domain Management

### 8.1 Domain Structure

We follow a multi-tenant architecture with subdomains:

```
[church-name].church.africa
```

Example:

```
gracebaptist.church.africa
```

### 8.2 Benefits of Subdomain Approach

1. **Isolation**: Each church gets its own isolated environment
2. **Security**: Separate SSL certificates and security contexts
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new churches without affecting others
4. **Branding**: Churches can use their own domain names if preferred

### 8.3 Domain Configuration

1. **DNS Setup**:

   ```
   *.church.africa.  IN  A  [your-server-ip]
   ```

2. **SSL Certificates**:

   - Wildcard certificate for \*.church.africa
   - Automatic renewal via Let's Encrypt

3. **Routing**:

   ```typescript
   // src/middleware.ts
   export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
     const hostname = request.headers.get('host') || '';
     const subdomain = hostname.split('.')[0];

     // Route to appropriate church instance
     return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(`/church/${subdomain}`, request.url));
   }
   ```

### 8.4 Church Registration Process

1. **Initial Registration**:

   - Choose church name
   - Verify availability
   - Complete registration form
   - Set up admin account

2. **Domain Activation**:

   - Automatic subdomain creation
   - SSL certificate generation
   - Initial setup completion

3. **Custom Domain Option**:
   - Churches can use their own domain
   - DNS configuration guide provided
   - SSL certificate management
