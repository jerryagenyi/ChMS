# Claude Model Selection Strategy

This document outlines the model selection strategy implemented for the Claude AI integration in our application.

## Overview

The Claude Taskmaster implements a cost-efficient model selection strategy that automatically chooses the appropriate Claude model based on task complexity. This approach optimizes for both cost and performance by using more powerful (and expensive) models only when necessary.

## Models and Their Characteristics

| Model | Strengths | Use Cases | Relative Cost |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Claude 3 Haiku** | Fast, cost-effective, good for most tasks | Simple questions, formatting, basic summaries | $ (Lowest) |
| **Claude 3 Sonnet** | More capable, balanced performance | Complex analysis, creative tasks, detailed explanations | $$ (Medium) |
| **Claude 3 Opus** | Most powerful, highest reasoning capability | Critical tasks, deep expertise, complex reasoning | $$$ (Highest) |

## Default Strategy

Our default model selection strategy follows these principles:

1. **Start with Haiku**: Use Claude 3 Haiku (most cost-effective) for low and medium complexity tasks
2. **Upgrade to Sonnet**: Use Claude 3 Sonnet for high complexity tasks that require more capabilities
3. **Reserve Opus**: Use Claude 3 Opus only for critical tasks that require maximum capability

This strategy is implemented in the `ClaudeTaskMaster` class:

```typescript
// Default model selection strategy
this.modelStrategy = {
  low: 'claude-3-haiku-20240229',      // Most cost-effective for simple tasks
  medium: 'claude-3-haiku-20240229',   // Still use Haiku for medium complexity
  high: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',    // Use Sonnet for complex tasks
  critical: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',  // Use Opus only for critical tasks
};
```

## Task Complexity Levels

Tasks are categorized into four complexity levels:

1. **Low**: Simple tasks like basic questions, formatting, or short explanations
   - Example: "What's the capital of France?"
   - Default model: Claude 3 Haiku

2. **Medium**: Moderate complexity tasks like summaries, explanations, or simple analysis
   - Example: "Summarize the key points of this article"
   - Default model: Claude 3 Haiku

3. **High**: Complex tasks requiring deeper analysis, creativity, or specialized knowledge
   - Example: "Analyze the implications of this research paper"
   - Default model: Claude 3 Sonnet

4. **Critical**: Highest importance tasks requiring maximum capability and expertise
   - Example: "Help debug this complex algorithm and identify optimization opportunities"
   - Default model: Claude 3 Opus

## Manual Override

Users can override the automatic model selection by explicitly specifying a model for a particular task. This is useful when:

- A user knows a specific task requires more capability despite seeming simple
- Testing or comparing model performance
- Optimizing for speed (by using Haiku) or quality (by using Opus)

## Cost Optimization

This strategy significantly reduces costs compared to using Sonnet or Opus exclusively:

- Most day-to-day tasks use Haiku, which is the most cost-effective model
- Sonnet is used only when additional capability is needed
- Opus is reserved for the most critical tasks

## Implementation Details

The model selection strategy is implemented in several components:

1. **ClaudeTaskMaster**: Manages the model selection logic based on task complexity
2. **API Endpoint**: Accepts complexity information and optional model override
3. **UI Component**: Allows users to specify task complexity and optionally override the model

### Token Usage Tracking

The system tracks estimated token usage for each task, which helps with:

- Monitoring costs
- Understanding usage patterns
- Identifying opportunities for optimization

## Customization

The model selection strategy can be customized by providing a different `modelStrategy` configuration when initializing the `ClaudeTaskMaster`:

```typescript
const taskMaster = new ClaudeTaskMaster({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  modelStrategy: {
    // Custom strategy - use Sonnet for medium complexity and above
    low: 'claude-3-haiku-20240229',
    medium: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    high: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    critical: 'claude-3-opus-20240229'
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

This model selection strategy provides an optimal balance between cost and performance by using the most appropriate Claude model for each task based on its complexity. By defaulting to the most cost-effective model (Haiku) and only using more powerful models when necessary, we can achieve significant cost savings while still delivering high-quality results.
