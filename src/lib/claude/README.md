# Claude Taskmaster

The Claude Taskmaster is a robust implementation for managing AI tasks using Anthropic's Claude API. It provides a structured way to create, execute, and track tasks that involve generating responses from Claude.

## Core Components

### ClaudeTaskMaster

The `ClaudeTaskMaster` class manages tasks for Claude AI interactions. It provides functionality to:

- Create tasks with unique IDs
- Execute tasks by sending prompts to Claude
- Track task status ('pending', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'failed')
- Retrieve tasks by ID or get all tasks
- Reset failed tasks for retry

### ClaudeClient

The `ClaudeClient` class handles communication with the Anthropic Claude API. It:

- Manages authentication with the API
- Formats requests according to the API requirements
- Processes responses from the API
- Handles errors gracefully

### API Endpoint

The `/api/claude/task` endpoint provides a RESTful interface for:

- Creating and executing tasks (POST)
- Retrieving tasks (GET)

### UI Component

The `ClaudeTaskForm` component provides a user-friendly interface for:

- Submitting prompts to Claude
- Displaying responses
- Handling loading states and errors
- Providing feedback via toast notifications

## Task Management Features

The Taskmaster implements several key features for effective task management:

1. **Unique Task IDs**: Each task has a unique identifier for tracking and retrieval
2. **Status Tracking**: Tasks progress through different statuses (pending → in-progress → completed/failed)
3. **Metadata Support**: Tasks can include arbitrary metadata for additional context
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
5. **Timestamp Tracking**: Creation and completion times are recorded for each task

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Create a task
const task = await taskMaster.createTask("Explain quantum computing in simple terms");

// Execute the task
const result = await taskMaster.executeTask(task.id);

// Check the result
if (result.success) {
  console.log(result.data); // Claude's response
} else {
  console.error(result.error); // Error message
}
```

### With Metadata

```typescript
// Create a task with metadata
const task = await taskMaster.createTask(
  "Summarize this article", 
  { 
    priority: "high",
    category: "content",
    source: "user-request"
  }
);
```

### Resetting Failed Tasks

```typescript
// Reset a failed task to try again
const resetTask = taskMaster.resetTask(failedTaskId);
if (resetTask) {
  const result = await taskMaster.executeTask(resetTask.id);
  // Process result...
}
```

## Error Handling

The Taskmaster uses specific error codes to help with programmatic error handling:

- `TASK_NOT_FOUND`: The requested task doesn't exist
- `TASK_FAILED`: The task previously failed and needs to be reset
- `API_ERROR`: An error occurred in the Claude API
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: An error occurred during task execution
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Input validation failed

## Implementation Details

The Taskmaster is implemented with TypeScript and follows best practices for:

- Type safety
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Testing

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the Taskmaster include:

1. Task persistence (database storage)
2. Task queuing for rate limiting
3. Batch task processing
4. Advanced prompt templating
5. Response streaming
6. Task cancellation
